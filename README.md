## Hello! Have you ever wanted to abuse your mobile device?

## Well I've got the [primitive site](https://samuelnub.github.io/oof) for you!

Inspired by a mobile app that does the same thing, this just uses the device's accelerometer to play either the Roblox or classic Minecraft Steve "oof" sound whenever the device receives a sudden change in acceleration (such as a drop).

This *should* work in Chrome, Safari, Firefox


Libraries used:

[Shake.js](https://github.com/alexgibson/shake.js)
